<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<div align="justify">
Our solution involves collecting and analyzing a wide range of data, including player statistics, match performance, and physical attributes, to identify key factors that influence player performance. By developing predictive models and performance metrics, we can provide coaches, scouts, and analysts with valuable tools for evaluating player performance, identifying talent, and making data-driven decisions.
